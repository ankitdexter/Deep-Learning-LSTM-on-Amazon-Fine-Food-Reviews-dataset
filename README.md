# Deep-Learning-LSTM-on-Amazon-Fine-Food-Reviews-dataset
Applied LSTM on Amazon Fine Food Reviews dataset, LSTM is sequential model which works very well with this data
We have applied General Machine learning models to Amazon reviews dataset which is there in this link-
https://github.com/ankitdexter/Case-study--Sentiment-analysis-on-Amazon-Fine-Food-Reviews-

After leveraging the idea of deep learning and mainly LSTM which focuses on sequential information in data, which suits our reviews which has sequential importance.
This new applied model gives best scores among others.
